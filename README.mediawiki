=== Chef Recipe - Ubuntu Tuneup ===
This Chef recipe will perform a few tweaks on linux systems, and a few Ubuntu specific tweaks on Ubuntu systems.
=== Tweaks Performed ===
*1) Remove landscape packages (Ubuntu only)
*2) Add aliases for ls -lh and ls -lhtr
*3) Add an alias to change rm into rm -i
*4) Change the history for root to maintain 5000 entries and have date/time stamps
*5) Export a nice bash PS1 for root
*6) Install vim
*7) Export vim as the default editor for root
=== Requirements ===
*1) Chef (Tested on Chef 12)
*2) Linux chef-clients (Tested on Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04 but kitchen will let you test anything you want)
*3) The line cookbook from Chef SuperMarket (tested and locked to 0.6.1)
=== Installation Tips ===
*1) I personally use Berks to install this into my Chef server, because it's easier.
=== Limitations ===
*1) This recipe has only been tested with Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04 but you can test it with any other Linux distro using kitchen. The full spec test is there.
**1a) Well sort of. I didn't spend the effort to escape the bash PS1 for spec testing so it only tests that /root/.profile has a PS1 exported.
=== Use cases ===
If you like the shell preferences I set (PS1, aliases, etc...) then you can use this module.
